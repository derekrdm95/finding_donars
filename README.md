Supervised learning project by Udacity

This is the first machine learning project I completed using Python on Udacity platform.

Here we used the data from **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, building a supervised learning model to predict whether each individual's income will be above $50k or not.

Here I first did the exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and processing numeric and categorical features separately. And then I employed three different supervised learning model including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost Classifier. And we find that AdaBoost seems to be the best model by comparing accuracy score and F-score.

Finally, by further tuning the parameters of Adaboost Model, the model achieved 0.8626 accuracy score and 0.7354.
